## üíª Method

We used our protein as a receptor and this next protein, CDKAL1, as a ligand:

![Q5VV42.png](Q5VV42.png)

**Cartoon representation of CDKAL1.**

Then we selected our protein is function of a `balanced` classification, which considerate `electrostatic-favored`, `hydrophobic-favored` and `VdW` interactions. Else, all options have been left as default.

## üìä Results

**Results of the protein-protein docking.** Each color indicates a different pose. Actually, all protein are docked in the same region, showing that the interacting zone is quite good/interesting.

**First part of observe results after protein-protein docking.** Here, two hydrophobic interaction are underline. Here, only residues with a distance of 5 √Ö are shown between the two docked protein.


![hydrophobic_interaction_2.png](hydrophobic_interaction_2.png)

**First part of observe results after protein-protein docking.** Here, three hydrophobic interaction are underline, but note that there is other type of interaction. Here, only residues with a distance of 5 √Ö are shown between the two docked protein.

Here two major points are notable:
1. The 10 best docking position are in the same localisation, showing that this localisation is a potential interaction area.
2. For the best docking position, a majority of the observed interactions are hydrophobic ones. This could lead to a problem that those part are, actually, expose to the solvant.
