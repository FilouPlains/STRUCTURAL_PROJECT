## üíª Method

We used our protein as a receptor and this next protein, CDKAL1, as a ligand:

**Cartoon representation of CDKAL1.**

Then we selected our protein is function of a `balanced` classification, which considerate `electrostatic-favored`, `hydrophobic-favored` and `VdW` interactions. Else, all options have been left as default.

## üìä Results

**Results of the protein-protein docking.** Each color indicates a different pose. Actually, all protein are docked in the same region, showing that the interacting zone is quite good/interesting.
